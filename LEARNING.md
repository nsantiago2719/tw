# Structured Learning Path for Developing a CLI Tool in Go

This structured plan will guide you through building a Go-based CLI tool step-by-step, ensuring you learn core Go concepts as you progress.

## 1. Start with the Basics
- Initialize your Go module if not already done (e.g., `go mod init github.com/nsantiago2719/tw`).  
- Create a simple `main.go` file that prints "Hello, World" to confirm your development environment is working.  
- Familiarize yourself with Go's directory structure and understand how `.go` files are grouped into packages.  
- Review the Go standard library, focusing on the `os` package (for interacting with the operating system) and the `fmt` package (for formatted I/O).

## 2. Incremental Learning Steps

### 2.1 Command-Line Arguments
- Start by handling command-line arguments directly with `os.Args`. Practice parsing input and printing it back to the user.  
- Incorporate basic validations and error handling, such as checking if the correct number of arguments has been provided.

### 2.2 Using the flag Package
- Migrate to the `flag` package from the standard library to parse flags and options.  
- Explore advanced usage like defining custom flag types and help messages.  
- Set up robust error handling to gracefully handle missing or invalid flags.

### 2.3 Error Handling and Logging
- Create a dedicated function or package for error handling.  
- Compare standard techniques for logging in Go, possibly using built-in logging or a lightweight third-party logger.

### 2.4 Testing
- Implement unit tests using Go's built-in `testing` package.  
- Practice test-driven development (TDD) by writing tests first to define expected behavior and then coding to fulfill the tests.  
- Use `go test` to run your tests, ensuring each new feature is properly covered.

## 3. Best Practices
- Follow idiomatic Go style: run `go fmt` to format code and `go vet` to check for common issues.  
- Use `golint` or `staticcheck` for adherence to style guidelines and best practices.  
- Add Go doc comments above each exported function, type, and package.  
- Keep commits small and focused. Always work in a branch and use pull requests for reviewing changes.

## 4. Project Structure
- Organize your code by feature or domain into packages, e.g., `cmd/`, `internal/`, and so on.  
- Keep the `main` package minimal, focusing mainly on CLI parsing and delegating business logic to other packages.  
- Ensure your README.md documents how to install and run the CLI tool and includes examples of usage.

## 5. Workflow and Version Control
- Initialize a Git repository right away.  
- Commit changes frequently, summarizing each commit's purpose.  
- Document important learnings, challenges, and design decisions in the README.md or a dedicated docs/ folder.  
- Continuously incorporate feedback from tests and reviews to refine your CLI tool.

By following these steps, you'll gain hands-on experience with Go's fundamentals while gradually building a useful CLI application.
